## Development

This project was built with the `reactR` package. See here for development instructions
from `reactR` https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reactR/vignettes/intro_htmlwidgets.html

### Dependencies

- Nodejs (install with nvm)
- Yarn (install with npm)


### Workflow

1. If you need to install a javascript dependency, install a javascript package with
```bash
yarn add PACKAGE_NAME
```
replacing `PACKAGE_NAME` with the package you are adding.

2. If you need to edit any javascript files, edit them now.

3. Download any other dependencies in package.json and then compile the packages to
js that the R package can access at inst/htmlwidgets/...

```bash
yarn install
yarn run webpack
```

4. Install the R package

```R
renv::activate()
devtools::document()
devtools::install(quick = TRUE)
```

5. Enjoy the package

```R
library(spacetimeview)
spacetimeview()
```
